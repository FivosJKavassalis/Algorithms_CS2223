2.

Hypothesis 1: 
My results show that when there are a large number of duplicate values, the overall sorting time should be
incremented. This can be easily detected, since the "Time Trials" results indicate that for a large N, the time
 trials for MergeU, QuickU and QuickAU are smaller than the corresponding time trials for MergeD, QuickD, QuickAD.
 Therefore, this hypothesis is false.
 
 Hypothesis 2:
 My results show that when there are a large number of duplicate values, the difference in the number of exchanges 
is inconclusive. The "Exch Results" results do not indicate a concrete difference in the number of 
exchanges for MergeU, QuickU and QuickAU with the corresponding number of exchanges for MergeD, QuickD, QuickAD.
 Therefore, this hypothesis is inconclusive.
 
4.1
The worst case for the number of comparisons that are performed to find the minimum element in the Maximum Priority Queue is
 logN * logN (N is the number of elements in the heap) because for [N = some power of 2 in a heap], we have to do [corresponding exponent * logN]
 comparisons to reach the min value, since every time we compare in a heap we end up with one of the two branches (logN).
