 * THIS IS A BONUS QUESTION. DO NOT ATTEMPT UNTIL ENTIRE HOMEWORK IS DONE.
 * 
 * Used to display properties of a normal distribution.
 * 
 * Has the following structure:
 * 
 * N = Number of Levels, here N=4
 * 
 *	               0       <- head
 *	              / \
 *	             1   2
 *	            / \ / \
 *	           3   4   5
 *	          / \ / \ / \
 * 	         6   7   8   9
 *	        / \ / \ / \ / \
 *  last-> A ->B-> C-> D-> E 
 *  
 * Each node in the first N levels has a left and right link to the nodes below it, as shown above.
 * For example, the left link of 1 points to 3 while the right link of 1 points to 4. The quincunx
 * knows the 'head' node, and also the 'last' node, which is the left-most node on the n+1 layer of
 * the quincunx. All of the nodes on the N+1 layer have their right links pointing to the node to its
 * right (with the exception of the rightmost node, E, above). The quincunx knows the 'last' node,
 * which is the leftmost node on the N+1 layer.
 *         
 * Here N=4 and this divides into FIVE possible bins: A, B, C, D, and E.
 *
 * The purpose of a quincunx is to simulate the normal distribution.
 *
 * See http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GaltonBoard.html for more details
 * 
 * There is a 'trial' method that starts a trial at the head node and randomly falling down
 * one level below (50% probability of going left, 50% of going right). Once this process repeats N
 * times, then one of the final N+1 nodes is the final destination.
 * 
 * This final layer can be "read" from left to right by traversing the 'right' link of the last node,
 * which is the lowest-left-most node.
 * 
 * When you complete this assignment, then you can replicate results as follows:
 * 
 * A sample run on a Quincunx board of size N=4 (and thus five nodes on layer N+1), with 1000 additions is
 * 
 * 62,263,368,233,74
 * 
 * Here is a sample run on a Quincunx board of size N=32 (and thus 33 nodes on layer N+1), with 10000 additions:
 * 
 * 0,0,0,0,0,0,2,11,28,58,155,325,495,780,1135,1331,1422,1275,1115,814,512,306,141,55,30,9,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
